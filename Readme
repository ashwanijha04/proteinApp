Contains a model that can predict the protein's secondary structure from its Amino-Acid sequence.

Algorithm: [Hidden]
Client: Contains a react ui.
JavaServer: Converts the amino acid sequence into numbers(that the ML model can read) and passes it to the model.
The flask app then uses the saved model to calculate the secondary structure of proteins.

Way to go!

PS: It would take 10 years and a lot of money to predict the structure in labs. 
Well, anyone who has been there would go for an algorithm that accurately predicts the structure around 87% of the times in less than a second.
